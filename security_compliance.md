# HIPAA and Security Compliance – AI on FHIR Platform

## Ensuring Data Privacy: HIPAA and GDPR Alignment

The AI on FHIR platform is designed with privacy, confidentiality, and data integrity at its core. In alignment with both HIPAA and GDPR standards, we ensure that all Protected Health Information (PHI) is handled with the highest level of security. All data transmissions between the frontend, backend, and FHIR-compliant systems are encrypted using HTTPS with TLS 1.2 or higher. No PHI is stored or processed on the client side, and all sensitive logic is confined to secure backend services.

Where applicable, we implement data minimization and anonymization techniques to reduce exposure risks, particularly in analytic and reporting layers. Our development practices emphasize privacy by design and ensure that security is integrated at every stage of the software lifecycle.

## Secure Authentication: OAuth 2.0 and SMART on FHIR

Authentication is implemented using the OAuth 2.0 standard, which enables secure, delegated access to health data. Our solution is built to support the SMART on FHIR specification, ensuring compatibility with major EHR vendors such as Epic, Cerner, and Allscripts. This allows clinicians and administrators to authenticate using their institution’s identity provider, streamlining access control while maintaining compliance with industry standards.

## Access Control: Role-Based Permissions

To protect sensitive patient data, the platform includes robust Role-Based Access Control (RBAC). User roles—such as clinician, nurse, or administrator—are assigned fine-grained permissions that determine the scope of accessible resources. For instance, a nurse may only access assigned patients’ vitals, while an administrator may have visibility into broader datasets for operational reporting. This flexible permission structure can be extended using token-based claims and scopes.

## Audit Logging and Accountability

All user interactions with sensitive data are recorded through an audit logging system. Each log captures critical information such as user identity, timestamp, action performed, and the data resource accessed. These logs support security auditing, breach detection, and regulatory compliance, and are stored in a secure, tamper-resistant format.

## Additional Security Measures and Best Practices

- Enforced HTTPS across all services using TLS encryption  
- Input sanitization and validation on both client and server sides  
- No PHI stored or cached in the browser or local storage  
- Deployment via containerized environments (Docker) with minimal attack surface  
- Backend services protected via firewall rules, environment-based access, and token-based API authorization

Through these strategies, our platform is well-positioned to meet the privacy and security expectations of modern healthcare applications. We are committed to continuously evolving our practices to remain aligned with emerging standards and threats in the health technology landscape.
